Welcome to BLITZ (Behavioral Learning In The Zebrafish)
======================
Introduction
------------
BLITZ (Behavioral Learning In The Zebrafish) is a software that allows researchers to train larval zebrafish to associate visual pattern with electric shock in a fully automated way, which is adapted from [MindControl][1] 
(Leifer, A.M., Fang-Yen, C., Gershow, M., Alkema, M., and Samuel A. D.T.,
 "Optogenetic manipulation of neural activity with high spatial resolution
 in freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans," Nature Methods, Submitted
 (2010).) <br/>
 
BLITZ processes multiple video streams of freely swimming larveas in real time. As feedback, it presents different visual patterns and give electric shocks to individual fish as user designed. With inputs and outputs in a close loop, researchers can training dozens of fish simultaneously with pre-designed behavioral paradigm in a fully automatic way. Detailed information about fish's position, the type of visual pattern, timing of given electric shocks and other system's state can be recorded in a user-defined way in YAML file, which is a human and computer readable file format. Also the raw video would be saved. The BLITZ-analysis software suite (MATLAB) produces quantitative analysis figures and formated quantification structure data based on the output from BLITZ.
